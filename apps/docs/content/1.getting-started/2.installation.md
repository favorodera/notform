## Quick Start

Add :name-text to your project using your preferred package manager:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add notform
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add notform
```
```bash [npm]
npm install notform
```
```bash [bun]
bun add notform
```
::

## Install a Validation Library

:name-text works with any standard-schema compatible validation library. Choose one based on your preferences:

### Zod (Recommended)

TypeScript-first schema validation with excellent type inference:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add zod
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add zod
```
```bash [npm]
npm install zod
```
```bash [bun]
bun add zod
```
::

### Yup

Popular schema validation with a simple API:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add yup
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add yup
```
```bash [npm]
npm install yup
```
```bash [bun]
bun add yup
```
::

### Valibot

Lightweight and modular validation library:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add valibot
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add valibot
```
```bash [npm]
npm install valibot
```
```bash [bun]
bun add valibot
```
::

::note
You only need to install **one** validation library. We recommend [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for its excellent TypeScript support and developer experience.

## Framework Compatibility

NotForm is built for Vue 3 and works seamlessly with:

- [**Vue 3**](https://vuejs.org/) - Full support with Composition API
- [**Nuxt 3/4**](https://nuxt.com/) - Works out of the box (dedicated module with auto-imports coming soon)
- [**Vite**](https://vite.dev/) - Optimized for Vite-based projects
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Full type safety with zero configuration

## TypeScript Support

:name-text is written in TypeScript and provides full type safety out of the box. Your form state will be automatically typed based on your validation schema:

```ts
import { useForm } from 'notform'
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number(),
  email: z.string().email()
})

const { state } = useForm({ schema })

// state is automatically typed as:
// {
//   name: string
//   age: number
//   email: string
// }
```

::tip
Enable `strict` mode in your `tsconfig.json` for the best type safety and developer experience.
::

## Verify Installation

To verify everything is working, try importing NotForm in a component:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm, Form, Field, Message, ArrayField } from 'notform'
import { z } from 'zod'

// If this imports without errors, you're all set! ✅
</script>
```

If the imports work without errors, you're ready to start building forms! 🎉
