## Why NotForm?

The name :name-text came about after discovering my original choice was already taken 😂. After a few minutes of brainstorming, I landed on this name and thought it had a nice ring to it.

:name-text is a standard-schema based Vue form validator designed to simplify form validation while preserving the natural "Vue way" of doing things. It provides a single composable and renderless components that give you everything needed to validate your forms with confidence.

It also includes an array field component that eliminates the complexity of handling dynamic array fields in your forms.

## What Makes NotForm Special?

:name-text isn't just another form library. It's built with specific principles that make form validation in Vue applications feel natural and intuitive.

### Type-Safe from the Ground Up

:name-text is written in TypeScript and leverages your validation schema to provide complete type safety throughout your forms. Get intelligent autocomplete suggestions, catch errors at compile time, and enjoy a superior developer experience with full IDE support.

Your schema becomes the single source of truth for both runtime validation and compile-time type checking.

### Built with Composition API

:name-text is designed specifically for Vue 3, NotForm embraces the Composition API to give you maximum flexibility and composability. Use the `useForm` composable alongside your other composables for a consistent, modern Vue development experience.

### Completely UI Agnostic

:name-text doesn't impose any styling or UI opinions on your application. Use it with Nuxt UI, ShadcnVue, Vuetify, Element Plus, PrimeVue, or build your own custom components from scratch.

The components are renderless and headless—they manage state and validation logic while giving you complete control over presentation and styling. Your UI library's components work exactly as they should.

### Framework Agnostic Validation

NotForm works with any standard-schema compatible validation library:

- **Zod** - TypeScript-first schema validation
- **Yup** - Dead simple object schema validation
- **Valibot** - Modular and type-safe validation
- **ArkType** - TypeScript's 1:1 validator
- Any library that implements the standard-schema interface

Define your schema once and let :name-text handle the rest.

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to create a validated form with NotForm:

::code-collapse
```vue [login.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm, Form, Field, Message } from 'notform'
import { z } from 'zod'

const { state, id, submit } = useForm({
  schema: z.object({
    email: z.email('Please enter a valid email'),
    password: z.string().min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters')
  }),
  onSubmit: async (data) => {
    // Your custom submission logic here
    console.log('Validated data:', data)
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <Form :id="id" @submit="submit">
    <Field name="email" v-slot="{ methods, name }">
        <label :for="name">
          Email
          <input
            v-model="state.email"
            type="email"
            :id="name"
            :name="name"
            v-bind="methods"
          />
          <Message :name="name" />
        </label>
    </Field>

    <Field name="password" v-slot="{ methods, name }">
        <label :for="name">
          Password
          <input
            v-model="state.password"
            type="password"
            :id="name"
            :name="name"
            v-bind="methods"
          />
          <Message :name="name" />
        </label>
    </Field>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </Form>
</template>
```

That's it! :name-text handles validation, error messages, form state, and submission for you.
